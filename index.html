    <h3>Origin</h3>
    <p>
      A pancake (or hot-cake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often
      thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs,
      milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying
      pan, often frying with oil or butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ancient Greeks made pancakes called τηγανίτης (tēganitēs), ταγηνίτης
      (tagēnitēs) or ταγηνίας (tagēnias), all words deriving from τάγηνον
      (tagēnon), "frying pan". The earliest attested references to tagenias are
      in the works of the 5th-century BC poets Cratinus and Magnes. Tagenites
      were made with wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled milk, and were
      served for breakfast.Pancakes have been around for centuries and are a
      staple in many cultures. Experts (pancakes experts?) believe that people
      enjoyed pancakes as far back as 30,000 years ago during the Stone Age. In
      fact, researchers found pancakes in the stomach of Ötzi the Iceman, famous
      human remains that date back more than 5,000 years! In ancient Greece and
      Rome, pancakes were made from wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled
      milk. Ancient Greek poets Cratinus and Magnes wrote about pancakes in
      their poetry. Shakespeare even mentions them in his famous plays. During
      the English Renaissance, people flavored their pancakes with spices,
      rosewater, sherry, and apples.

    <h4>Preparations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt,
        and nutmeg.
      </li>
      <li>In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk.</li>
      <li>
        Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium
        heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the
        flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter
        onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking
        care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the
        surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2
        minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second
        side.
      </li>
    </ul>
